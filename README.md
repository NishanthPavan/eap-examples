eap-examples
============

Just a few simple examples of EAP.

 - HornetQ Clustering - A simplified example of HornetQ clustering in Standalone and Domain mode (with simple CLI scripts for setup)
 - Servlet Generic Header Authenticator - One approach to providing authentication based upon a (trusted) header from a proxy server. This approach can be used to provide limited integration with some third-party authentication products.
